 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Vitruvian cables only pull UPWARD from floor platform
 * - Compatible: Rows, presses, curls, squats, deadlifts, raises
 * - NOT compatible: Pulldowns, pushdowns (require overhead anchor)
 * - Machine tracks each cable independently (loadA, loadB, posA, posB)
 * - Weight is always specified as "per cable" in the BLE protocol
