/**
 * Exercise model - represents any exercise that can be performed on the Vitruvian Trainer
 *
 * MIGRATION NOTE: This was converted from an enum to a data class to support the exercise library
 * with 100+ exercises instead of being limited to hardcoded values.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Vitruvian cables only pull UPWARD from floor platform
 * - Compatible: Rows, presses, curls, squats, deadlifts, raises
 * - NOT compatible: Pulldowns, pushdowns (require overhead anchor)
 * - Machine tracks each cable independently (loadA, loadB, posA, posB)
 * - Weight is always specified as "per cable" in the BLE protocol
